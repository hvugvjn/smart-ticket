Title: Level-5 Intelligent Ticket Booking Platform  
Tech: React + TypeScript + Vite | Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL | Redis | SSE/WebSockets  
Deliverables: Advanced UI/UX, High-Concurrency Booking Engine, OTP Auth, Real-Time Seat Locking, Analytics, Scalability Diagram, Automated Tests, Demo Video.

Objective
Build a next-generation ticket booking platform that delivers a smoother, faster, and more intelligent experience than existing apps like RedBus, IRCTC, MyTicket, or Ixigo. The system must support high concurrency, real-time seat locking, mobile OTP authentication, and intelligent seat selection, with a premium-grade UI/UX optimized for simplicity and speed.

Your app must feel more:
• responsive than RedBus  
• cleaner than MyTicket  
• well-structured than IRCTC  
• smarter than Ixigo  

Priority: create a “best-in-class booking experience” with data-driven intelligence and polished user design.

Core Features

1. Authentication (Mobile OTP)
• Fast login via OTP (4–6 digit code).  
• Rate-limited requests with cool-down (3 attempts in 10 minutes).  
• OTP must expire in 2–3 minutes.  
• After login, user receives a JWT (HttpOnly cookie).  

2. Real-Time Seat Availability (Competitive Advantage)
• Seat layout must update in real-time (WebSockets/SSE).  
• Seat locking: when a user selects seats, lock them for 60 seconds.  
• Lock must auto-release if user doesn't confirm.  
• Display countdown timer to confirm booking.

3. Intelligent Seat Recommendation Engine
• Auto-pick "best seats" based on:  
  - center preference  
  - group seating  
  - popularity heatmap  
• Show reason: “Best fit for 3 seats together”, “Center-most options”, etc.

4. High-Concurrency Booking Engine (Core Differentiator)
• POST /book must use:  
  - transaction isolation  
  - SELECT ... FOR UPDATE row locking  
  - idempotency keys  
• Support 200+ concurrent booking attempts correctly.  
• Show concurrency metrics in your README.

5. Admin Dashboard (Operational Excellence)
• Create shows/bus trips/routes/events  
• Upload seat layout via JSON  
• View live occupancy (chart)  
• View booking funnel  
• Track PENDING > EXPIRED > CONFIRMED counts  

6. Booking Features (Superior UX)
• Seat map should be visually superior to RedBus:  
  - animated hover states  
  - shape-coded seats  
  - color gradients for popularity  
  - fade-out for unavailable seats  
• Quick-Book mode: select and checkout in < 12 seconds.  
• Sharing feature: “Share seat selection with a friend”.

7. Booking Expiry + Retry Logic  
• PENDING bookings expire after 90 seconds.  
• Expiry handled by background worker.  
• Auto-notify user if seat is taken and show similar alternatives.

8. Notifications
• Booking confirmation email/SMS (mock).  
• Reminder 30 minutes before show/travel.  
• In-app notifications panel for updates.

9. Wallet + Credits System  
• Add wallet to allow:  
  - cashback rewards  
  - instant refunds  
  - credits for failed payments  

10. Search & Discovery Smarter Than Competitors
• Search by:  
  - route  
  - time  
  - seat comfort  
  - ratings  
  - price range  
• Intelligent sorting: “Cheapest”, “Fastest”, “Most Comfortable”, “Most Spacious”.

11. UI/UX Requirements (Must outperform RedBus/IRCTC)
Your design must:
• be minimal, classy, modern  
• use soft animations  
• use responsive design  
• load in < 1 second after initial fetch  
• avoid clutter like IRCTC  
• avoid ad-heavy interface like RedBus  

Critical UI commandments:
• 3-tap booking flow  
• Easy seat visualization  
• Consistent margins, padding, spacing  
• Dark mode (optional but impressive)  
• Booking timeline animation  
• Progressive loading skeletons  

12. Performance & Quality Engineering
• Automated tests for booking concurrency  
• Load-test script (Artillery/k6)  
• Lighthouse report for performance  
• API documentation (Swagger or Postman)

13. Architecture Documentation (Mandatory for Level-5)
Your README must include:
• High-level architecture diagram  
• DB schema  
• Real-time pipeline (for seat locking)  
• Booking flow diagram  
• Scaling strategy:  
  - Redis caching  
  - partitioning  
  - horizontal scaling  
  - lock contention strategies  

14. Video Demonstration (Top-1% Requirement)
Your recording must show:
• booking under concurrency  
• real-time seat map updates  
• OTP login  
• admin dashboard  
• intelligent recommendation engine  
• architecture explanation  

15. Deliverables
• Live Frontend URL  
• Live Backend URL  
• GitHub repo (frontend + backend)  
• README with diagrams + load test results  
• 6–8 minute demo video  
• Postman/Swagger collection
