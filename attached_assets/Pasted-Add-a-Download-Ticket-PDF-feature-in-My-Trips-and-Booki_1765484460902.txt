Add a "Download Ticket (PDF)" feature in My Trips and Booking confirmation.

Goals
- Allow user to download a PDF ticket with booking details and QR code.
- PDF includes: Booking ID, Operator, Date, Departure time & pickup label, Arrival time & drop label, Seats, Passenger name/email, Fare, QR code (URL to booking).
- Use server-side PDF generation and serve as endpoint: GET /api/bookings/:id/ticket (returns application/pdf)

Backend tasks
1. Install pdf generation libs:
   - `npm install pdfkit qrcode`
   - Or use `html-pdf` and `puppeteer` if you prefer HTML templates; prefer PDFKit for simpler server install.
2. Create endpoint:
   - GET /api/bookings/:id/ticket
   - Behavior:
     • Verify user owns booking (or admin).
     • Fetch booking, passenger, trip data.
     • Generate QR code (use `qrcode.toDataURL`) containing link `${FRONTEND_URL}/my-trips/${booking.id}`
     • Use PDFKit to programmatically render the ticket:
         - Header with NexTravel logo (if available)
         - Booking details table
         - Passenger details
         - QR code image
     • Stream PDF back with headers:
         `Content-Type: application/pdf`
         `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="nextravel-ticket-<bookingId>.pdf"`
   - Log: console.log('GENERATED PDF', booking.id)

Files to change/create (server)
- server/src/routes/tickets.js (CREATE)
- server/src/controllers/ticketsController.js (CREATE)
- server/src/lib/pdf.js (CREATE helper using PDFKit & qrcode)

Frontend tasks
1. Add Download button:
   - client/src/pages/my-trips.tsx (UPDATE) — Add "Download Ticket" button that fetches `/api/bookings/:id/ticket` and triggers browser download.
   - Use window.open or fetch blob and createObjectURL.

Acceptance
- Clicking Download Ticket returns a PDF that opens/downloads with the correct data and QR code.
- Server console logs 'GENERATED PDF <id>'.
- Provide changed files list and a sample PDF screenshot (or screenshot of download dialog).

Start now and return changed/created file list, server logs sample, and one PDF screenshot.
