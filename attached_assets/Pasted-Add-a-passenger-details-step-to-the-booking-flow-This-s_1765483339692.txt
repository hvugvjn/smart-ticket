Add a passenger-details step to the booking flow. This step must collect: gender, phone number, and one government ID (type + number). The data must be validated, persisted with the booking, included in the booking API payload, stored in DB, and shown in the booking confirmation email. Implement UI, client logic, server validation, DB changes, and email content updates.

GOALS (high level)
• When users confirm seats they must be prompted (modal or page) to provide passenger details:
  - Gender: select (male / female / other)
  - Phone number: required, E.164-ish validation for India (allow local 10-digit, store with country code +91)
  - Government ID: select one from dropdown: [Aadhar Card, Driving Licence, Passport, PAN Card, Voter ID]; input field for ID number (required)
• Validate inputs on client and server.
• Include passenger details in booking DB record and in confirmation email.
• Make this step mandatory before booking API call.
• Do not change visual design except small layout for new fields.

TASKS (exact implementation)

A — UI: PassengerDetailsModal (frontend)
1. Create file: `client/src/components/PassengerDetailsModal.tsx`
   - Props:
     ```
     {
       open: boolean,
       onClose: ()=>void,
       onSubmit: (passenger: { gender, phone, idType, idNumber })=>Promise<void>,
       defaultPhone?: string
     }
     ```
   - Fields:
     • Gender: radio buttons — "Male", "Female", "Other" (required)
     • Phone: text input — placeholder "Enter phone (10 digits)" (required)
     • Gov ID type: select/dropdown with options:
       `["Aadhar Card","Driving Licence","Passport","PAN Card","Voter ID"]` (required)
     • Gov ID number: text input (required)
   - Validation rules (client-side):
     • gender must be one of the options
     • phone must be digits only length 10 (allow +91 optional). Normalize to `+91XXXXXXXXXX` before submit.
     • idType must be selected
     • idNumber must be non-empty (you may add basic regex for Aadhar (12 digits) and PAN (10 alnum) if you want but keep simple: min 4 chars).
   - UI behavior:
     • Show inline validation messages.
     • Disable submit button until all inputs valid.
     • When submit clicked call `onSubmit(passenger)` and show spinner while awaiting.
     • On success call `onClose()`.
   - Console logs:
     • `console.log('PASSENGER DETAILS SUBMIT', passenger)` when submit is invoked.

B — Integrate into booking flow (frontend)
1. Update `client/src/pages/booking/[id].tsx` (or booking.tsx):
   - When user has selected seats and clicks Confirm Booking:
     • Instead of calling booking API directly, open `<PassengerDetailsModal open={true} ... />`.
     • On `onSubmit(passenger)` gather booking payload:
       ```
       {
         tripId,
         userId,              // from auth
         seats: [...],
         pickupPointId,
         dropPointId,
         passenger,           // object { gender, phone, idType, idNumber }
         amount,
         currency: 'INR'
       }
       ```
     • Call POST `/api/bookings` with this payload (see server changes).
     • Show success / failure as before.
   - Add console logs:
     • `console.log('BOOKING PAYLOAD', payload)` before sending.
     • `console.log('BOOKING RESPONSE', response)` after.

C — Backend: booking route must accept and validate passenger details
1. Update server booking controller (`server/src/controllers/bookings.js` or equivalent) to accept passenger object in request body.
2. Validate server-side:
   - Ensure `passenger` exists and contains `gender`, `phone`, `idType`, `idNumber`.
   - Validate phone: strip non-digits; ensure 10 digits; convert to `+91XXXXXXXXXX` (if length=10).
   - Validate gender in allowed set.
   - Validate idType is one of allowed list.
   - Return 400 with `{ error: '<message>' }` if validation fails.
   - Add `console.log('BOOKING REQUEST BODY', req.body)` at handler start.
3. Booking logic:
   - Continue to perform transactional seat allocation as before.
   - Store `passenger` details in booking table (or separate booking_passengers table) — see DB changes below.
4. Email:
   - Include passenger info in booking confirmation email body:
     • Gender
     • Phone (formatted)
     • Gov ID type and masked ID number (mask middle characters where appropriate; e.g., show first2 + '****' + last2 or leave full if short).
   - Log `console.log('Sent booking confirmation to', to, 'for booking', booking.id)` after send.

D — DB changes
1. If using bookings table, add columns or child table:
   - Option A (preferred): new table `booking_passengers`:
     ```
     booking_id (FK), gender VARCHAR, phone VARCHAR, id_type VARCHAR, id_number VARCHAR, created_at
     ```
   - Option B: JSON column in bookings table:
     - Add `passenger JSONB` or `passenger_details TEXT` (store JSON string). Acceptable if DB supports JSON.
2. Provide migration SQL/Prisma change accordingly. Example SQL for Option A:
