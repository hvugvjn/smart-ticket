Fix the non-editable FROM / TO / DATE controls so they are fully functional inputs in App mode. Do not change visual design — only behavior and minimal markup/CSS fixes. Implement controlled inputs, a searchable India-only LocationSelect, and a keyboard-accessible datepicker. Also remove any overlay or CSS that blocks pointer events for these controls.

Tasks:
1. Create controlled LocationSelect component:
   - Path: client/src/components/LocationSelect.tsx
   - Props: { value, onChange, placeholder }
   - Implements a searchable dropdown from the static Indian city list:
     ["Mumbai","Delhi","Bengaluru","Chennai","Kolkata","Hyderabad","Pune","Ahmedabad","Jaipur","Lucknow","Kochi","Goa","Varanasi","Nagpur","Surat","Indore","Bhubaneswar","Mysore","Amritsar","Visakhapatnam"]
   - Keyboard nav (up/down/enter), accessible aria attributes.
   - No external API calls.

2. Create DatePickerInput:
   - Path: client/src/components/DatePickerInput.tsx
   - Use react-datepicker or react-day-picker (install if missing).
   - Allow dates from today to 6 months ahead.
   - Output ISO date string to parent via onChange.

3. Update Home Search form:
   - File: client/src/pages/home.tsx
   - Replace current FROM and TO render with <LocationSelect /> controlled components bound to state.
   - Replace DATE input with <DatePickerInput /> bound to state.
   - Ensure SEARCH submits selected values (from, to, date) to existing search handler.

4. Update Booking page (prefill):
   - File: client/src/pages/booking/[id].tsx or client/src/pages/booking.tsx
   - If booking page pre-fills FROM/TO/DATE from props, ensure it maps to new controlled state.
   - Make seat-selection and booking flows unchanged.

5. CSS / Overlay fixes:
   - Search for any CSS that sets `pointer-events: none` on the form items or that overlays an invisible element above the inputs. Remove or adjust z-index.
   - Ensure inputs have `z-index: 10` and their overlay panels (modals) do not block them.

6. Quick safety: Add small unit to confirm interactivity:
   - After change, add a console.log onChange for FROM/TO and date that prints value on each change so we can confirm input is firing.

Acceptance criteria (automated check):
- FROM and TO are editable by typing and selecting suggestions.
- Date picker opens calendar and allows selection.
- Console logs appear when typing/selecting (so agent should include console.log statements).
- Provide changed files list when done.

Start now and return the changed file list and a screenshot of the working search bar showing FROM and TO editable and calendar open.
