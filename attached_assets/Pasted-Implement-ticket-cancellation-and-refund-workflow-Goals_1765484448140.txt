Implement ticket cancellation and refund workflow.

Goals
- User can cancel a confirmed booking via My Trips.
- Cancellation rules: if cancellation >24 hours before departure => full refund minus INR 50 cancellation fee; otherwise partial refund 50% minus INR 50; if within 2 hours => non-refundable.
- On cancel: mark booking as CANCELLED, increase seat availability, send cancellation email to user, and log refund amount.
- Provide refund record (DB table) and show refund status in UI.

Backend tasks
1. Add bookings.status ENUM: ["PENDING","CONFIRMED","CANCELLED"] and bookings.refund_status ENUM: ["NONE","PENDING","COMPLETED","FAILED"].
2. Create refunds table:
   - id, booking_id, amount, currency, status, created_at, processed_at
3. Add endpoint:
   - POST /api/bookings/:bookingId/cancel
   - Behavior:
     • Verify booking exists and belongs to user (or admin).
     • Compute refund according to rules using booking.date_iso and departure time.
     • Perform DB transaction: mark booking.status = 'CANCELLED', add refunds row, increment seat availability rows.
     • Attempt to process refund (simulated: mark refunds.status = 'COMPLETED' instantly — real payment providers omitted).
     • Send cancellation confirmation email including refund amount.
     • Return 200 with { bookingId, refundAmount, status }.
   - Log: console.log('BOOKING_CANCEL', bookingId, { refundAmount, status })

4. Add route to server/src/routes/bookings.js for cancel.

Frontend tasks
1. My Trips page:
   - Add Cancel button on eligible bookings (status CONFIRMED).
   - On click show confirmation modal with computed refund amount (call backend to compute or compute same logic in frontend).
   - On confirm call POST /api/bookings/:id/cancel
   - Show success toast and update UI to CANCELLED and show refund details.
2. Add cancellation email content in server/src/lib/mail.js to send to user.

Acceptance
- Cancelled booking shows in My Trips with status CANCELLED and refund amount.
- Server logs show BOOKING_CANCEL with refund details.
- User receives cancellation email (or backend logs a sent message).

Return changed files list, console sample showing BOOKING_CANCEL, and screenshot of My Trips entry showing cancelled booking and refund.
