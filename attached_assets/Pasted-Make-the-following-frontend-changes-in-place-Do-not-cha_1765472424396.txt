Make the following frontend changes in-place. Do not change the visual design — only update code and behavior. After changes, show me the changed file list and a short run checklist.

1) FROM / TO inputs (editable)
- Replace the current non-editable FROM and TO fields with searchable dropdown inputs.
- Use a reusable component `LocationSelect` (client/src/components/LocationSelect.tsx) which accepts `value, onChange, placeholder`.
- The dropdown should use a static list of Indian cities (below). Implement local filtering (type to search).
- When a trip card is created or edited, ensure the Trip's source/destination use these city values.

Use this list of Indian locations (include at minimum):
["Mumbai","Delhi","Bengaluru","Chennai","Kolkata","Hyderabad","Pune","Ahmedabad","Jaipur","Lucknow","Kochi","Goa","Varanasi","Nagpur","Surat","Indore","Bhubaneswar","Mysore","Amritsar","Visakhapatnam"]

2) Date picker (calendar) for “Pick a date”
- Replace the current placeholder with a proper date picker.
- Use a lightweight datepicker (react-datepicker or react-day-picker). Create `DatePickerInput` in `client/src/components/DatePickerInput.tsx`.
- The datepicker should:
  • Allow date selection only from today up to 6 months in future.
  • Output ISO date string to parent component.
  • Be keyboard accessible and show a small calendar icon.
- Wire the date value into the search form and booking flow (`Home` search and `Booking` pages).

3) Currency & Pricing: convert to INR
- Replace all displayed currency values from USD ($) to INR (₹).
- Update price formatting across app to Indian locale: use `new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', { style: 'currency', currency: 'INR' }).format(price)`.
- Update sample data and admin Create Trip modal default currency to INR and default price values in INR.
- In Admin create/edit trip modal, change label "Price ($)" → "Price (INR)".

4) Replace USA sample locations
- Update any hard-coded sample trips and seed data to use Indian cities from the list above (e.g., Mumbai → Bengaluru, Delhi → Chennai).
- Update hero search default values to show Indian cities by default.

5) Gmail OTP (Email OTP) instead of Phone OTP
- Replace phone number OTP flow with email OTP flow:
  • Update UI labels: "Verify OTP — Enter the 4-digit code sent to <email>".
  • API endpoints used by frontend should be `/api/auth/request-otp-email` and `/api/auth/verify-otp-email`.
  • The frontend should POST `{ email }` to request OTP; server logs OTP to console (mock) and returns success.
  • Verification: POST `{ email, code }` to verify and on success set JWT cookie and mark `isAuthenticated`.
- Implement `OtpEmailModal` at `client/src/components/OtpEmailModal.tsx` (or update existing OTP modal).
- Rate-limit hint in UI: "Max 3 requests per 10 minutes" and show resend cooldown.

6) Ensure Login button opens Email OTP modal and My Trips shows user bookings
- Wire Login button (Header) to open `OtpEmailModal`.
- After successful verification, display user avatar/name in header and enable My Trips link.
- Implement `MyTrips` page (client/src/pages/my-trips.tsx) to fetch `GET /api/bookings?userId=<id>` if backend exists, otherwise show stored bookings in localStorage/fallback.

7) Preserve selection & resume booking
- If user selects seats or initiates a booking while unauthenticated:
  • Save selection into `AuthContext` or localStorage (key: `pending_booking`).
  • After successful email OTP login, automatically redirect/resume to `/booking/:id` and restore previously selected seats so user can confirm immediately.

8) Accessibility & microcopy fixes
- Change displayed terms:
  • Replace "Show" / "Shows" → "Trip" / "Trips" across the UI and Admin modal labels.
  • Update top-nav breadcrumb accordingly.
- Ensure the small tick/check button has `aria-label="Verified account"` and a hover tooltip.

9) Files to change / create (agent: search for matching names if different)
- Update: `client/src/pages/home.tsx`
- Update: `client/src/pages/admin.tsx` (change "Show" → "Trip", Price label)
- Update: `client/src/pages/booking/[id].tsx` or `client/src/pages/booking.tsx`
- Update: `client/src/components/Header.tsx` or NavBar
- Update/create: `client/src/components/LocationSelect.tsx`
- Update/create: `client/src/components/DatePickerInput.tsx`
- Update/create: `client/src/components/OtpEmailModal.tsx`
- Update/create: `client/src/pages/my-trips.tsx`
- Update: any seed/static sample data file (e.g., `client/src/data/sampleTrips.ts`)

10) Minimal tests
- Add one frontend test that:
  • Simulates clicking Book while unauthenticated,
  • Verifies the Email OTP modal opens,
  • Mocks a successful OTP verification and verifies that the booking page restores selected seats.
- Place test in `client/src/__tests__/auth-resume.test.tsx`.

11) Developer notes & assumptions
- If backend API is not available, use a mock service layer `client/src/services/mockApi.ts` to simulate `/api/auth/*` and `/api/bookings`.
- For live backend, ensure `VITE_API_BASE` env is used for API calls (`import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE`).
- Preserve all existing styles and components; keep changes behavior-only unless a small markup tweak is necessary for accessibility.

12) Quick acceptance checks (run after changes)
- Home: FROM and TO accept typed input and show results.
- Datepicker: clicking "Pick a date" opens calendar and stores date.
- Currency: Price displayed as ₹45,000 (example) across app.
- Login: clicking Login opens Email OTP modal; entering mock code authenticates user.
- Booking resume: select seats → click Book → login → return to booking page → seats restored.
- My Trips: after login, My Trips page shows user bookings.

Start implementing now and return with:
1. List of changed / created files (paths).  
2. One screenshot showing the email OTP modal open.  
3. One screenshot showing the datepicker calendar open.  
4. Confirmation that currency shows INR symbol.
