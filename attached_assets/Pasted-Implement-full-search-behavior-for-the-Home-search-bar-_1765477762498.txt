Implement full search behavior for the Home search bar and results display.

Goal
When the user clicks SEARCH (or presses Enter) the app must:
1. Validate inputs (FROM, TO, DATE).
2. Fetch matching trips from the backend if available:
   GET /api/shows?from=<from>&to=<to>&date=<YYYY-MM-DD>
3. If backend is not available, fallback to client-side filtering of sampleTrips data.
4. Render the search results list below the search bar or show a "No buses available" message.
5. Disable the SEARCH button until FROM, TO and DATE are selected.

Detailed tasks

A — Frontend: search handler
1. Update file: `client/src/pages/home.tsx`
   - Add a controlled `onSearch()` function that:
     • Validates `from`, `to`, `date` — if any missing, show inline error (e.g., "Please select From / To / Date").
     • If `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE` is set and reachable, call:
         `GET ${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE}/api/shows?from=${encodeURIComponent(from)}&to=${encodeURIComponent(to)}&date=${date}`
       - Use `fetch` with 6s timeout.
       - If response status 200, parse JSON and use returned `shows` array.
       - If network error or non-2xx, fallback to client filter (see B).
     • If `VITE_API_BASE` is not set or fetch fails, filter local sample trips (client/src/data/sampleTrips.ts).
       - Filter criteria: exact case-insensitive match for source and destination and date (if trips include date); if trips do not include date, filter only by source/destination.
     • Set `results` state to the resulting array and set `isSearched=true`.

   - Add UX behaviors:
     • Disable SEARCH button until all three fields have values.
     • Show a short loading spinner on the SEARCH button while the request/filter runs.
     • If results.length === 0, show a friendly block:
         "No buses available for Mumbai → Bengaluru on 2025-12-13. Try different dates or cities."
     • If results found, render a list of trip cards (reuse existing trip card component if present). Each card must show:
         - Operator name
         - Departure time
         - Arrival time
         - Duration
         - Price (use existing INR formatter)
         - "View Seats" button linking to `/booking/:id` (id from trip object)

B — Frontend: client-side fallback & sample data
1. Ensure `client/src/data/sampleTrips.ts` exists and exports an array of trip objects with fields at minimum:
