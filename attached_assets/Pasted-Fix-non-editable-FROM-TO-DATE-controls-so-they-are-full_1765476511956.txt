Fix non-editable FROM / TO / DATE controls so they are fully functional in App mode. Do not change the visual design — change behavior, markup and minimal CSS only.

Goals (high level)
• Replace static/mock inputs with controlled, interactive components.
• Add a searchable India-only LocationSelect with keyboard navigation.
• Add a keyboard-accessible datepicker (today → +6 months).
• Remove any CSS/overlay blocking pointer events.
• Wire components into home search and booking pages.
• Add console.logs to verify interactivity.

Tasks (implement exactly)

1) Create LocationSelect component
Path: client/src/components/LocationSelect.tsx
Props: { value: string, onChange: (v:string)=>void, placeholder?: string, id?:string }
Behavior:
 - Searchable dropdown built from the static city list below.
 - Keyboard support: ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Escape.
 - Accessible ARIA attributes (combobox, listbox, option).
 - Use onMouseDown for option selection to avoid input blur issues.
 - Console.log('FROM', value) or console.log('TO', value) when onChange called (for debug).

City list (use exactly):
["Mumbai","Delhi","Bengaluru","Chennai","Kolkata","Hyderabad","Pune","Ahmedabad","Jaipur","Lucknow","Kochi","Goa","Varanasi","Nagpur","Surat","Indore","Bhubaneswar","Mysore","Amritsar","Visakhapatnam"]

2) Create DatePickerInput component
Path: client/src/components/DatePickerInput.tsx
Requirements:
 - Use react-datepicker or react-day-picker. (Install instructions below.)
 - Allow dates from today up to 6 months ahead.
 - Return ISO string (YYYY-MM-DD) in onChange callback.
 - Accessible and keyboard friendly.
 - Console.log('DATE SELECTED', iso) on change.

3) Update home search form
Path: client/src/pages/home.tsx
Changes:
 - Replace current FROM and TO UI with <LocationSelect value={from} onChange={setFrom} />.
 - Replace current date input with <DatePickerInput value={date} onChange={setDate} />.
 - Ensure SEARCH button uses current state { from, to, date } and console.log('SEARCH', {from,to,date}) when clicked.
 - If existing search handler exists, invoke it with these values.

4) Update booking page prefill
Path: client/src/pages/booking/[id].tsx or client/src/pages/booking.tsx
Changes:
 - Map server-provided trip props to controlled state if present:
    const [from,setFrom] = useState(trip?.source || '');
    useEffect(()=> setFrom(trip?.source || ''), [trip]);
 - Ensure date prefill maps similarly.
 - Do not change booking or seat-selection logic.

5) CSS / overlay fixes
 - Search project CSS for `pointer-events: none` and remove or scope it away from search inputs.
 - Add this override to global CSS (client/src/index.css) to ensure inputs accept interaction:
