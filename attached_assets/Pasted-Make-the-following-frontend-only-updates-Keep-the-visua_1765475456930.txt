Make the following frontend-only updates. Keep the visual design identical; change behavior, labels and data only. After changes, return the changed file list and 3 screenshots (OTP sent toast, datepicker open, seat map showing INR prices).

A. Remove server-log OTP hint and show email-only OTP UX
1. Remove or hide any UI text that says "Check server logs for your OTP" or similar.
2. Show a toast/inline message after request-otp-email: "OTP sent — check your email (and spam folder)". Keep resend cooldown text (e.g., "Resend available in 59s").
3. Ensure the OTP modal copy reads: "Enter the 4-digit code sent to <email>" (no server log message).
4. Keep OTP generation & backend unchanged; only replace client-side messages.

B. FROM / TO inputs — editable, India-only searchable selector
1. Replace the current non-editable FROM and TO fields with a searchable dropdown component `client/src/components/LocationSelect.tsx`.
2. Behavior:
   • Accept `value, onChange, placeholder`.
   • Filter list as user types (case-insensitive).
   • Allow keyboard navigation and Enter selection.
3. Use the following static city list (India-only):
   ["Mumbai","Delhi","Bengaluru","Chennai","Kolkata","Hyderabad","Pune","Ahmedabad","Jaipur","Lucknow","Kochi","Goa","Varanasi","Nagpur","Surat","Indore","Bhubaneswar","Mysore","Amritsar","Visakhapatnam"]
4. Wire the new component into:
   • `client/src/pages/home.tsx` (hero search FROM/TO)
   • `client/src/pages/booking/[id].tsx` or `client/src/pages/booking.tsx` (if any prefilled route)
   • Admin create/edit trip modal so admin selects cities from same list.
5. Persist selected FROM/TO values into the search form state; on search, results should respect selected cities.

C. Datepicker — proper calendar control
1. Add `client/src/components/DatePickerInput.tsx` using `react-datepicker` or `react-day-picker`.
2. Requirements:
   • Calendar icon and placeholder "Pick a date".
   • Allow selection from **today** up to **6 months** from now.
   • Keyboard accessible.
   • Output ISO date string to parent (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
3. Wire into `home.tsx` search form and booking page so selected date is passed to API/search logic.

D. Currency — convert all USD ($) to INR (₹)
1. Replace all hard-coded USD signs and price strings with locale-aware INR formatting:
   ```js
   new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', { style: 'currency', currency: 'INR' }).format(price)
