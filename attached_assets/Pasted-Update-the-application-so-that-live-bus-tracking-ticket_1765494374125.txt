Update the application so that live bus tracking, ticket details, PDF download, and cancellation options are moved to the My Trips → Trip Details page instead of the main booking page.

Changes required:

1. Remove the live tracking section from:  
   - client/src/pages/booking/[id].tsx  
   - This includes the map, the progress bar, and the "Track my bus live" button.

2. Add a new Trip Details Page:
   Path: client/src/pages/my-trips/[bookingId].tsx

   This page should display:
   - Bus Name, Bus Type
   - Booking ID
   - Pickup and Drop names
   - Travel Date
   - Seat numbers
   - Total amount paid
   - Trip status (Confirmed / Cancelled)

3. Add a Live Map Tracking Section:
   - Use the same Leaflet map component currently used in booking page.
   - Show route: pickup → drop
   - Show bus marker that updates position from `/api/buses/:busId/location`
   - Include a "Track My Bus Live" button that refreshes every 10 seconds.

4. Add a Download Ticket (PDF) button:
   - Use server endpoint `/api/bookings/:id/ticket`
   - Generate PDF using pdfkit (already installed) or existing PDF logic.
   - Download file as: NexTravel_Ticket_<bookingId>.pdf

5. Add Cancel Ticket functionality:
   - POST request to `/api/bookings/:id/cancel`
   - Must show confirmation modal:  
     “Are you sure you want to cancel this ticket?”
   - After cancel, update status in DB and show message.

6. Update MyTrips page:
   - Clicking any trip should navigate to the new Trip Details page:
     /my-trips/<bookingId>

7. UI Styling:
   - Match NexTravel theme (dark background, cyan highlights).
   - Use a card layout similar to booking-confirmed page.
   - Keep header fixed.
   - Ensure no content is hidden under header.

8. Backend updates:
   - Ensure booking details API returns:
       ticket info + seat info + pickup/drop + busId for tracking.
   - Ensure `/api/buses/:busId/location` works for live updates.

9. Remove Track My Bus section from booking page completely.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Booking page shows ONLY seat selection → confirm button.
- My Trips → Trip Details shows all trip information + tracking + PDF + cancel.
- Track My Bus feature works correctly.
- PDF downloads successfully.
- Cancel ticket updates immediately on both UI and database.
